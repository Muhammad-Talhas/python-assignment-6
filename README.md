06_Build_Compose_and_Decorate_A_Complete_Traditional_OOP_Practice_Series
This repository contains a series of 21 Python assignments designed to practice and reinforce core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, including class design, inheritance, decorators, access control, and more. Each assignment targets a specific OOP principle, demonstrating how traditional OOP is implemented in Python.

Focus: Use of class variables and class methods with cls.

3. Public Variables and Methods
Task: Create a Car class with a public variable brand and method start().
Focus: Accessing public members from outside the class.

4. Class Variables and Class Methods
Task: Create a Bank class with a class variable bank_name.
Focus: Modify class variables using class methods.

5. Static Variables and Static Methods
Task: Create a MathUtils class with a static method add(a, b).
Focus: Static methods without accessing class or instance data.

Task: Create a Logger class that prints messages upon creation and destruction.
Focus: Understanding __init__ and __del__ methods.

7. Access Modifiers: Public, Private, and Protected
Task: Create an Employee class with public, protected, and private variables.
Focus: Accessing variables with different access modifiers and documenting behavior.

8. The super() Function
Task: Create a Person base class and Teacher subclass using super().
Focus: Calling parent class constructors.

9. Abstract Classes and Methods
Task: Use the abc module to create an abstract class Shape with an abstract method area().

Task: Create a Dog class with instance variables and an instance method bark().
Focus: Instance method usage.

11. Class Methods
Task: Create a Book class with a class variable total_books and method to increment it.
Focus: Managing class-level data.

Task: Create an Engine class and a Car class, composing Engine inside Car.
Focus: Object composition.

14. Aggregation
Task: Create Department and Employee classes using aggregation.

Focus: Objects referencing other independent objects.

15. Method Resolution Order (MRO) and Diamond Inheritance
Task: Implement classes A, B, C, and D to observe MRO with diamond inheritance.
Focus: Understanding MRO in multiple inheritance.

16. Function Decorators
Task: Write a decorator log_function_call that logs before function execution.
Focus: Function decorators.

17. Class Decorators
Task: Create a class decorator add_greeting that adds a greet() method.
Focus: Modifying class behavior dynamically.

18. Property Decorators: @property, @setter, and @deleter
